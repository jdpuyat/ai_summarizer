# Similar to the personal portfolio site I built by following JS Mastery's video guide
# I followed his new video on how to build and deploy your own GPT AI website

# It uses an Article Extractor and Summarizer API
# https://rapidapi.com/restyler/api/article-extractor-and-summarizer
# to summarize a URL, display a summary, and save the last 5 searches locally
# to refer back to.

# This time around, I made extra effort to read up on what I was coding, looking up
# the related documentation, and when receiving an error, really taking the time
# to attempt to troubleshoot and research on my own.

# I may not have put in the personalisation like I did with the portfolio project
# but this project really helped me work on my troubleshooting and researching
# of documentation, as well as dip my toes into implementing and using API's.
